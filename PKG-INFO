Description: README for Python Implementation of LinkedIn API
        
        LinkedIn API for Python
        =======================
          This package provides a pure python interface for the LinkedIn Connection and Profile APIs.
        
          Author: `Ozgur Vatansever <ozgurvt@gmail.com>`
        
          LinkedIn (http://developer.linkedin.com) provides a service that let people bring their LinkedIn profiles
          and networks with them to your site or application via their OAuth based API. This library provides a simple
          architecture over a complicated LinkedIn OAuth based API to make it for python programmers easy to use.
        
        
        INSTALLATION
        ============
          You have 2 options:
        
          1) Getting the code from repository:
             - svn co http...
        
          2) Getting the code from Google Code website of python-linkedin
             - wget bla bla..
        
          Enter the directory you've just downloaded, and execute the following command on shell to install the package:
          - sudo python setup.py install
        
        
        BASIC USAGE
        ===========
        
          In order to use it you have an 'application key' and 'application secret'.
          For debugging I am providing you those. You can use the following as api key and secret:
        
          KEY = wFNJekVpDCJtRPFX812pQsJee-gt0zO4X5XmG6wcfSOSlLocxodAXNMbl0_hw3Vl
          SECRET = daJDa6_8UcnGMw1yuq9TjoO_PMKukXMo8vEMo7Qv5J-G3SPgrAV0FqFCd0TNjQyG
        
          You can use "http://localhost" as the return url. Return URL is a url where LinkedIn redirects the user after he/she grants access to
          your application.
          """
          from linkedin import linkedin
        
          RETURN_URL = "http://localhost" 
        
          api = linkedin.LinkedIn(KEY, SECRET, RETURN_URL)
        
          result = api.requestToken() # result can be True or False
          # if True, you can open your browser and copy the authorization url of LinkedIn.
          api.getAuthorizeURL() # open this url on your browser
          
          # When you grants access to the application, you will be redirected to the return url with the following query strings appended to your RETURN_URL:
          http://localhost/?oauth_token=0b27806e-feec-41d4-aac5-619ba43770f1&oauth_verifier=04874
          auth_verifier = 04874
          # After you get the verifier, you call the accessToken() method to get the access token.
          result = api.accessToken("04874") # result can be True or False
          # if True, now you can fetch the methods that LinkedIn provides. 
         
          # To fetch your profile, simply call GetProfile method.
          profile = api.GetProfile()
          profile.id # is your id (may be null)
        
          # if you know your public url, call the method above with your public url for more information
          profile = api.GetProfile(member_id = None, url = "http://www.linkedin.com/in/ozgurv")
          profile.id # is your id
          profile.first_name
          profile.last_name
          profile.picture_url
          ... 
          ...
        
          # To fetch your connections, simply call 
          connections = api.GetConnections() # connections is a list of profiles
